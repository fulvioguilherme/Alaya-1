                                <p>Payment for Doula Care is due on the 37th week of your pregnancy, for lactation care it is due the end of our visit, I will offer you a receipt for payment with a bill for your insurance company if you would like one. *Not all insurance companies will reimburse for lactation consultant visits but I have had very good success with Google employees and Aetna is currently reimbursing a portion for lactation bills.  Currently there is no reimbursement for Doula work.
It is your responsibility to check with your insurance carrier about their policy beforehand, and the obligation of payment is yours regardless of insurance or other third party involvement.

                                <p>“One thing I really admire about Serena is her integrity and commitment to accuracy regarding scientific findings and evidence in research. Serena carefully investigates claims and evaluates the quality of articles (both research studies and information in the popular press) before posting or commenting on them. This type of critical thinking and screening is quite valuable in an age where many people post and repost before gathering adequate information about credibility of claims and quality of reporting.” -Yvette Malamud Ozer
</p> <br>

<p> “The early days of breastfeeding can really make a woman question her own ability; Serena was able to help me in invaluable ways, passing on her vast knowledge in a kind and generous way. She was easy to trust and my babies and I owe much of our success to her efforts.” -Christy Wood </p>

<p><br>
"Serena turned my miseries in breastfeeding into a beautiful bonding time with my son.  I had so many questions and doubts about breastfeeding which led me to seek advice from family, friends, internet, the hospital which only led me down the path of even more confusion. It was not until I talked to Serena that things finally turned around.  Her approach is a very calming, knowledgeable, non-judgmental, and wonderfully supportive.  Serena helped me to see that I wasn't doing as bad as it seemed after all, and showed me how to relax and comfortably hold and feed my baby so we could enjoy the experience." -Karen N. </p>

"It is no exaggeration to say that Serena Meyer was integral to my breastfeeding success.  I was lucky to have had everything go right the first few weeks of breastfeeding my first daughter, but then things changed.  I started having pain during the initial latch and during the start of each feeding.  It got so bad that my nipples were sore and bleeding which caused more pain during the initial latch.   I was starting to cringe and dread each time I heard my newborn cry for food and was thinking about supplementing with formula or giving up altogether to alleviate the pain.  Then I found Serena.  She came to my house and watched and listened to a feeding and told me she thought the problem was clamping.  I was so relieved to hear her suggestions and after a short while the problems cleared up and the pain was gone.  During that week or so of intense pain I was seriously contemplating giving up breastfeeding so I am extremely thankful for the help and support of Serena.  I am proud to say that I went on to breastfeed until just after my daughter's second birthday and it was my most rewarding experience as a mother by far.  I wholeheartedly recommend Serena's services and have given her name out to several friends who were also having problems. " -Meg Pitts </p>

"I consider myself to be a knowledgeable person. One of my majors in college was Molecular Biology, and before having kids I was a researcher. As much as I think I may know about how things work, Serena blows me away. I haven't seen someone in years research as much information and be as genuinely excited and interested in what she is finding as Serena is. You can feel her passion for understanding breastfeeding, how the body produces milk, and its incredible qualities from the moment you enter conversation with her. Not only does she have such a unique curiosity and desire to know and learn, but she is gifted with the ability to be nonjudgmental and supportive of what families decide work best for them. She is happy to give all the information she has about any issue or concern that a family may have, let them know what the implications are for each choice they might make, and then be supportive of their rights to make those choices. I feel this truly sets her above and beyond. She has such a calmness and reassuring attitude while giving advice and support, that anyone who works with her is sure to feel a release by the end of it. I wish I knew her and could call on her when I was struggling in the early days with my first daughter, and she surely helped me numerous times after the birth of my second daughter. I am honored to know her both as a nursing mother and a professional, and it gives me great pleasure to recommend all of my doula clients to her for any breastfeeding related support, no matter what age the nursling is, from first latch to gentle weaning." -Tabitha Ames</p>

<br> "I am a mother of three - oldest adopted, middle one I gave birth to, third one just recently adopted at birth. After having nursed my middle child, I knew for sure I wanted to try to nurse my adopted third baby when she was born (I did not know adoptive nursing was an option with my firstborn). I was so eager, I started the process long before we were ever matched with a birth mother. I got discouraged after waiting for a match and was experiencing trouble with relactation for several reasons, one being the long wait. Serena was patient and kind and full of good advice. Most importantly, she was understanding and did not pressure me beyond what I was capable of. I decided to stop pumping until after we had been matched, with Serena's kind support. When we were finally matched, I was ready to go full bore and within three months was pumping a full supply before the baby was even born. We were in the hospital when our baby was born, and the nursing staff was impressed and happy to see that adoptive nursing is possible. I am nursing my youngest full-time and making more than enough milk. A huge part of successful lactation is the peace of mind of the mother, and Serena was amazing at helping me achieve that peace. She is patient and knowledgable (and funny!), and I absolutely know that my journey would have been much more difficult without her support. Peace, love, and leche." -Jill Fenske</p>
