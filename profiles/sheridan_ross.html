                                <p>I have been working with new families as a Postpartum Doula since 2002.  In 2011 I certified as an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant after graduating from the UC San Diego Lactation Consultant program. I happily nursed my own son and daughter with what I thought at the time was no difficulty. Once I became an IBCLC, however, I realized that several of my son’s issues (colic, night waking, frequent illnesses) could have been avoided had I had more help and information. I also had no family nearby so I really understand what a difference postpartum help can make. I love being able to help parents navigate their “new normal” with a baby.

I am a member of the International and United States Lactation Consultant Associations, as well as the Bay Area Lactation Association. I also participate in Doula circles around the Bay.

My husband and I have lived in Alameda since 1987 and have four grown children. We really do love long walks on the beach and seeing movies at our restored 1932 Art Deco theatre.

                                <p>Peggy is AMAZING!! We hired her for 3 months of postpartum work with our newborn twins, and she was absolutely wonderful. From the moment she arrived, she filled our home a sense of peace that does not come easily with newborns. As I recovered from a c-section, Peggy cared for me AND the babies seamlessly. She taught me so much about having newborns, from how to feed them to bathing to getting them to nap. Peggy is a great teacher of breast-feeing, and as breast-feeding became increasingly difficult for me, Peggy supported me entirely with the (emotionally difficult) change of plan. I feel so grateful to have had Peggy as my postpartum doula, and recommend her highly to anyone whom just had a baby (or babies!). - Rae T </p> <br> 

                                <p>This review is long overdue. Peggy is a lifesaver. 

After giving birth to a 9lb baby I was determined to breastfeed. Upon coming home from the hospital, we noticed that our baby didn't pee as much. And when he did it was accompanied with orange/rust crystals on his diaper - a sure sign of dehydration. That's when we started to panic. I thought my son was getting enough milk because I was bfd'ing on cue. At this point, my nipples were raw and I was hurting a lot. 

My baby was born Tuesday, I look at Lactation Consultants on Yelp and found Peggy. I call her on Friday and she was at my doorstep on Sunday. Peggy introduced us to the world of tongue ties. My son had a lip and tongue tie that was hindering him from latching properly. Peggy endorsed the services of Dr. Yazdi and the next Tuesday, my son underwent a frenectomy. Problem solved. 

Peggy did a follow up visit, she answered all of our questions and she definitely helped me out a lot when it came to engorgement and plugged duct issues. She went above and beyond my expectations. She is the best! - Meryl A </p> <br>

<p> I can't imagine a better, more professional post partum doula.  Peggy literally saved my life as a new single mother with recovering from a c section. I suffered from post partum hypertension.  When my blood pressure went up to 170 I called the doctor and was told to come in.  I had no one to help with my new born.  I called  peggy that sunday she showed up, took me to hospital, held my baby while i had all these test done, and stayed with me while i picked up my meds.  Peggy was amazing.  Her help is invaluable. - Donna D. </p><br>

<p>After 8weeks of painful breastfeeding and pointless visits to another lactation consultant, I reached out to Peggy as I was ready to quit nursing. She confirmed that my baby had a lip and tongue tie, something I had suspected she had but no other health professional had mentioned it despite my protests of pain and discomfort. She came to our house and really took the time to listen to me and offered me the support I needed when I was at my breaking point. We still have a ways to go in fixing the breastfeeding issues, but I feel so much more hopeful after having worked with Peggy. She is very knowledgable and I will recommend her to all my friends! She also offers a weekly drop-in group for breastfeeding moms, check out her Facebook page for time/location. - Nelly M</p> <br>

<p>I was so fortunate to have worked with Peggy two years ago when I had my first son! I attended a breastfeeding support group she facilitated and also a new moms' group where she provided lactation advice and support. Peggy's practical, culturally-sensitive approach helped me become a more confident breastfeeding mama (now on #2!). She listens carefully,  guides gently and follows up with resources/research. I definitely recommend her services to new moms needing a lactation consultant.- Nayeli C</p> <br>

<p>I've known Peggy for 23 years she is a women who has always been passionate about the care and respect of life. She is intelligent, kind and highly skilled in her profession. She worked as a Doula for a family with twins that I provided childcare for, and the mother couldn't say enough good things about the sound advice, support and resourcefulness that Peggy provided her in helping her with her twin newborns. I highly recommend Peggy to any mother searching for a Doula or Lactation Consultant. - Peggy H</p> <br>

<p>Peggy is incredibly heart centered and skilled in her profession as a postpartum doula and a lactation consultant.  She takes her job very seriously and it is a delight to meet someone so good at what they do.  
I am blessed to have found Peggy at the right time.  I was dealing with some serious challenges after just having given birth and not really having a plan for aftercare or support.  
After making a few phone calls, first to La Leche, I realized I had a problem.  My baby wasn't wetting enough diapers or very alert at the time.  Nor was I in a position to feed, because I was just in so much pain.  
Peggy was luckily available in the same day for assistance--which I needed immediately.  Initially I thought it was the doula side of Peggy I needed.  She arrived and immediately helped my engorged breasts by implementing a protocol that I had only seen a link online for and needed help with.   She insisted on feeding the baby with the milk that was leaking out of my breasts by finger feeding and measurement.  
I quickly understood that my well being was linked with my baby's and once my baby was happy, I would be too.  Peggy's lactation advisor skills took precedent. As a new mom, many people want to offer their suggestions and support and I had more than my share of people I was listening to.  Peggy made it clear she wanted to be "my person" of authority and I am so grateful she made this suggestion.  I quickly let everyone else's opinions and insights go and developed trust with her advice and skill.   This was VERY important.  

My child's health and vitality improved drastically by working with Peggy.  We were working with elevated bilirubin which was undetected or minimized by the midwives at first and saw an amazing chiropractor thanks to her referral --Radiant Health in Alameda--which was absolutely a magical treatment and continued the progress.

Peggy was there to put us back on track realizing we had a rough start but that we could quickly steer in a better direction.  

After 3 weeks my baby is back at his birth weight and we have his latching problem which would have been undetected--- fixed!!  

Thanks to Peggy, we got the right assistance at the right time.   Visiting the chiropractor was a necessity to my child at a critical phase as was getting the right referral to a dentist for the tongue tie amendment.  We had what was considered a "minor" problem, but having it fixed has made ALL the difference.  

Thank you Peggy!!!

Yay for babies and lactation consultants!!  And angels.  Peggy's a real life angel.  She continues to be a reliable source and encyclopedia of trusted information sites.  Maybe a little too much info at times, but hey, i'm not complaining.</p>
